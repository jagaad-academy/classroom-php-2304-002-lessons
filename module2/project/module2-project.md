# Module 2 Project

Update the **module 1 project** to use the **MySQL** database instead of the filesystem.

Create a new page to manage (add, read, update, and delete) the **classrooms**. The classrooms **should be listed** on the page form to insert/update students (the table of students should contain the classroom ID - one-to-many).

- **Add a report that shows the students by classroom**
- **Add a login page**

**Topics to consider:**

- Use the `input_filter` function to get data from the form
- Add validations to the inputs
- Show messages properly
- Use the techniques learned during Module 2.
- The module 2 updates should be sent using a new branch via Merge Request.

**Code quality recommendations:**

- Attention to the code indentation;
- Organize your code into files/functions;

## Deadline

**TBD**
