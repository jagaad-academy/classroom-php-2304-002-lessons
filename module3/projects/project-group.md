# Module 3 Project - Group

Create an application that contains the following characteristics:

1. CRUD using PDO.
2. Fully use the object-oriented paradigm.
3. Have at least two tables with a one-to-many relationship.
4. Push the code to a new GitHub repository (public).
5. Including CSS in the web user interface (UI) is optional.

Discuss with your group the type of business of the application (e.g., shopping, school, daily activities, games, etc.). Use the techniques learned until module 3 of the course. Help each other in the group, and make sure everyone contributes to the application code and business rules.

## Teamwork

As we have learned in previous lessons, there are some techniques to work in teams on a software project (revisit Scrum and eXtreme Programming); some of them are:

1. [Create a DM group on Slack with your teammates](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500002969782-Add-people-to-a-direct-message).
2. Define a recurrent update that everyone in the group should send in Slack (e.g., daily, weekly). The update should say, what you have done, what you're going to do, and if you have any blockers (ask for help).
3. Have quick calls with the teammates if needed.
4. Create tasks using the GitLab issues and assign them to each group member (help each other).


## Evaluation

The teamwork communication, tasks created on GitLab, commits, README files describing the application, the decisions taken, and the application code quality will be considered in the evaluation.
